In this project I have implemented a YOLOv3 object detector to detect objects in arbitrary images.
The ideas presented in the notebook of the project (YOLO_v3.ipynb) come primarily from YOLO papers as well as the material taught by professor Andrew NG in the "Convolutional neural networks" course on Coursera website. 
- The implementation is mostly inspired by [**experiencor**](https://github.com/experiencor/keras-yolo3)'s GitHub repository and uses many components from it. 
- The pretrained weights can be downloaded from [YOLO website](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/). They are also provided in the "DarkNet_weights" folder!
#YOLO papers:
1. [You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640)
2. [YOLO9000: Better, Faster, Stronger](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242)
3. [YOLOv3: An Incremental Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767)

**Note**: 
I have modified several components of the code based on my understanding to make it faster and more accurate. This is only my understanding of how things work and it might not be 100% correct. Besides, I have explained each and every step in details in the notebook file. Those explenations are also based on my understanding and might not be 100% accurate/true.
